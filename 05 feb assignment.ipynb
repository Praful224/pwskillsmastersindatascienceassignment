    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the technique of hiding the internal details of an object from the outside world and providing a public interface to access and modify the object's state. Encapsulation helps to achieve data security, data integrity, and code maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism in which a new class is created by inheriting the properties and behavior of an existing class. The new class is called the derived class or subclass, and the existing class is called the base class or superclass. Inheritance facilitates code reuse, reduces code redundancy, and enhances code readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism means the ability of an object to take on many forms or the ability of a method to behave in different ways depending on the context of its invocation. Polymorphism enables code flexibility, code extensibility, and code reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction refers to the technique of representing complex real-world entities as simplified models in software. Abstraction involves identifying the essential features and ignoring the non-essential features of an object or a system. Abstraction helps to reduce code complexity, enhance code readability, and improve code maintainability."
